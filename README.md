Overview
This project explores whether a football player can realistically reach their potential rating using machine learning.
By analysing key attributes from a FIFA dataset—such as age, playing position, overall rating, and projected potential—the model predicts player growth and provides insights into long-term development patterns.
The goal was to understand how different characteristics influence player progression and to demonstrate how data-driven modelling can be applied in sports analytics.

📊 Machine Learning Approach
The model predicts whether a player will reach or fall short of their potential rating.
Steps involved:
Data Cleaning
Removing missing values, standardising attribute formats, and selecting meaningful features.
Feature Engineering
Using age, potential, position, and overall rating as predictors.
Model Training
Implemented using Random Forest Classifier, chosen for interpretability and strong baseline performance.
Evaluation
Assessed model accuracy, confusion matrix, and key feature contributions.

📈 Insights
Younger players generally have a higher probability of reaching projected potential.
Playing position shows significant influence—certain positions mature differently.
The gap between current rating and potential rating is a strong predictor of growth trajectory.
